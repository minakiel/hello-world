# hello-world

Hi there!

I'm a newbie (not a total), currently taking CS50 online course from edX. 
A geek that loves Japanese manga, drawing, science fiction movies, RPG's and Nintendo games.
My goals: complete CS50, learn Python and Java, because I want to have some other skills apart from typical Excel, Word and Outlook stuff.
